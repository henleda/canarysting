# docs/ROADMAP.md — Path to a Design-Partner Demo

Read `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` first. This document is the build
plan. It sequences the work from the current scaffold to a **working demo we can
run for prospective design partners**. It is a living document: as milestones
land, update status here.

The architecture docs say *what* CanarySting is and *why*. This says *what we
build, in what order, and where it runs*. Where this conflicts with a layer doc
on intent, the layer doc wins; this doc governs sequencing.

---

## 0. The goal that orders everything

**Land design partners by showing, live, the thing no incumbent ships:** a canary
touch triggers an automated, escalating, **kernel-enforced** response that imposes
asymmetric economic cost on an automated/LLM attacker — with low false positives
*by construction* (the guardrail), and learned state that never leaves the
customer's boundary (scope isolation). And on top of the control, the thing that
makes it compound: a **proprietary adversary-intelligence asset** (`INTELLIGENCE.md`)
that sharpens with every deployment — profiling, an attacker-cost KPI, an
early-warning recon signal, and a cross-customer network — built so that only
anonymized patterns ever cross a boundary and raw data never does. The control
gets us in; the intelligence is the moat, and the demo shows both.

### Locked decisions (review on 2026-06-03)

These are settled and now drive the plan:

1. **Audience = enterprise CISOs + enterprise infrastructure teams.** The demo
   must read as production-credible, not a toy. **Kernel enforcement (eBPF) is
   core to the first demo**, not a later beat.
2. **Real Envoy, no reference dataplane.** We integrate the real proxy from the
   start. We have time, and a hand-rolled shim would undercut credibility with
   infra teams.
3. **No placeholder or dummy data, anywhere in the demo.** The baseline and
   calibration panels show **real** learned state, accrued from genuine traffic in
   a persistent staged environment over a real learning window (see M7). We do
   not fake a baseline or seed fake feedback.
4. **Polished Next.js front-end.** The product dashboard is the surface a CISO
   sees; it must be highly polished. (Separate from the corporate
   `canarysting-www` property.)
5. **LLM-attacker, phased:** a scripted client for the development loop, and a
   **real LLM agent** for the demo itself (the why-now, made visible).
6. **No time pressure. Quality over speed.** A 3–4 month horizon is acceptable.
   We do this right.
7. **Single-host containers for the first demo; Kubernetes/EKS to follow.** K8s
   feasibility is being researched (see §7); it is expected to be viable and is a
   post-first-demo milestone.
8. **The full intelligence layer is in demo #1** *(decided 2026-06-05)*. The
   compounding adversary-intelligence asset (`INTELLIGENCE.md`) is not deferred:
   the vantage-point event store, adversary profiling, the attacker-cost KPI, the
   recon early-warning signal, in-deployment detection sharpening, the
   cross-customer network (demonstrated with a real **second** deployment/scope,
   not mock data), and the threat-feed read view are **all** in scope for the
   first demo. Rationale: the intelligence is the asset investors price and the
   durable moat; the demo must show it, not just the control. Consequence: the
   M7 learning window must accrue **real adversary-interaction history** (the
   attacker runs against the environment during the window), not benign baseline
   traffic alone — this widens the long pole (see §4). Accepted under decision 6.

We optimize for **a credible, real, polished demo** — not feature completeness,
and not raw speed.

## 1. The demo narrative (what a prospect sees)

A single live screen, staged in a small AWS environment (containers on one host
for the first demo):

1. **The fabric.** A handful of microservices behind a real **Envoy** proxy.
   Canaries seeded in the *negative space* of normal traffic (paths/ports/
   adjacencies legitimate flows never use), so a touch is almost certainly
   hostile. The baseline that identifies that negative space is **real** —
   learned from genuine traffic the environment has been generating (M7).
2. **The attacker.** An automated client — first a scripted client, then an
   actual **LLM agent** — performs recon and lateral movement.
3. **The escalation.** It brushes a canary → **Tier 0** (observe, score ticks).
   It keeps probing distinct canaries inside a tight window → **Tier 1** (tag) →
   **Tier 2** (contain + attrition begins). The suspicion score and tier ladder
   animate live.
4. **The sting (the wow).** At Tier 2 the attacker is tarpitted and fed an
   endless, plausible fake directory tree / fake secrets engineered to trigger
   expensive parsing. A meter shows **attacker time + tokens + compute burned**.
   The **defender's** cost stays flat — every generator is bounded.
5. **The precision (the CISO proof).** **Tier 3** jails the exact offending
   socket **in the kernel** (by socket cookie, via eBPF). A legitimate bystander
   flow on the same host keeps working — proving we contain the *flow*, not the
   host.
6. **The credibility panels — all backed by real learned state:**
   - *Guardrail:* a wildly abnormal flow that never touches a canary → **nothing
     happens** (deviation is not a trigger).
   - *Baseline:* the same single touch from an abnormal flow escalates faster
     (bounded multiplier sharpening a real signal), driven by the **real**
     accrued baseline.
   - *Scope/calibration:* per-scope calibrated/uncalibrated state, surfaced
     honestly, reflecting **real** accrued evidence.
7. **The moat — the compounding intelligence (the investor/CISO differentiator).**
   Layered on the same live run, backed only by real accrued events:
   - *Recon early-warning:* the quiet probing in the negative space surfaced
     *before* the loud part — an early-warning feed, never an enforcement action
     (the guardrail still holds). (Track D / D4.)
   - *Adversary profile:* the system recognizes the actor by a **behavioral
     fingerprint** — its probing order, its reaction to tagging and tarpitting,
     its timing — derived from real interaction history. (D2.)
   - *Attacker-cost KPI:* the cost meter from beat 4 rolled up into the
     board-level number a CISO reports — time imposed, tokens/compute burned,
     requests absorbed, per scope. (D3.)
   - *The cross-customer money-shot:* a fingerprint learned in this deployment is
     anonymized and passed through the **single default-deny egress filter** —
     shown live **dropping** anything raw or environment-identifying — and then
     sharpens detection in a **second** deployment/scope. The second scope is a
     *real* second deployment, not mock data. This is the compounding loop and
     the trust proof in one frame: the network gets smarter, raw data never
     moves. (D6, with the threat-feed read view D7.)

That screen *is* the product. The milestones below build its pieces.

## 2. Environments

| Where | Runs on | What we build there |
|---|---|---|
| **Local dev** | this macOS/arm64 Mac | The pure-Go libraries developed and unit-tested in isolation: engine, baseline math, canary catalog, attrition generators, all unit/integration tests. No kernel needed for these. |
| **AWS Linux (the demo stack)** | EC2, Ubuntu 24.04, kernel ≥5.15 with BTF | Everything that needs a kernel or a real proxy: eBPF loader + `enforce.bpf.c`, the real socket-cookie identity join, the Envoy adapter, the persistent staged environment, the dashboard, the scenario + LLM attacker. The demo runs here. |

**Hard constraint:** eBPF (CO-RE, cilium/ebpf) and the real socket-cookie join
need a recent Linux kernel with BTF, and the Envoy adapter needs real Envoy —
none of which run on macOS. Because the kernel and the proxy are now *core* to
the first demo, **the AWS box is needed early** (M0). We still develop the engine
and the attrition generators as pure-Go libraries locally, then integrate them on
AWS.

---

## 3. Milestones

Three tracks that converge on the demo. Estimates are rough engineering days for
the two of us, under the tests-as-invariants discipline (§5). No date pressure —
estimates size effort, not a deadline.

### Track A — the engine and sting libraries (pure Go, local)

#### M1 — Engine core  · 3–5 days · ← **DONE (2026-06-05)**
The brain runs end-to-end in-process — no proxy, no kernel.
- `scope.Resolver` — resolution order (zone → derived cluster id → operator
  boundary → **hard fail**); never a global scope.
- `scoring.Scorer` — windowed weighted sum over *distinct* canary touches;
  uniform weights = raw count at cold start; benign-exclusion as a first-class
  input.
- `tiers.Decider` — score→tier under per-tier strictness; documented static
  uncalibrated threshold map (from `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 base rates); async-only
  for 0–1; reject async+proxy-only enforcement for 2–3.
- `calibration.Calibrator` + `feedback.Intake` — one evidence floor gates
  uncalibrated→calibrated for **all** learned params together; per-scope only.
- `cmd/engine/main.go` — wire them; serve `contract.Engine`; refuse to start on
  `scope.ErrUnresolved`.
- **Tests are a deliverable:** 0→1→2→3 escalation; scope A never affects scope B;
  cold-start raw-count; refuse-to-start; fail-open T1 / fail-closed T3.
- **Exit (met):** a flow's signals drive a real verdict end-to-end
  (`internal/engine`, `cmd/engine -selfcheck`); 43 tests, `make check` green,
  each core invariant has a failing-if-violated test. See `docs/ENGINE.md`
  "Implementation status (M1)".

#### M2 — Baseline multiplier  · 2–3 days · ← **DONE (2026-06-05)**
- [x] Implement `M(d)` exactly per `BASELINE_MULTIPLIER.md`: per-feature caps →
  bounded `d` → saturating `g(d)` → `M ∈ [1, M_max]`; `Score = base × M`
  (`internal/engine/baseline`; `scoring` applies it via a `MultiplierSource`).
- [x] Force `M = 1.0` when uncalibrated / stale / time-bucket-sparse
  (`baseline.Store`, tied to the shared evidence floor).
- [x] Property tests: `M ≥ 1` always; `base = 0 ⇒ Score = 0`; the four worked
  examples in §5; per-feature outlier bounding; monotonic/saturating.
- **Exit (met):** the guardrail is arithmetic and proven by test. Defaults in
  `config/`. The live baseline + per-flow feature derivation are fed by the eBPF
  path (M5/M7); until then `M = 1` in the scoring path (documented in
  `BASELINE_MULTIPLIER.md` §10a).

#### M3 — Canary layer  · 2–4 days · ← **DONE (2026-06-05)**
- [x] `catalog` — the five canary types with seed-weight priors; generators
  **provably** cannot emit a functional secret (reserved/EXAMPLE namespaces +
  structural invalidity; per-type predicate + construction-time check + fail-
  closed `Generate` gate + universal cross-scan); canaries kept **independent**
  (flat registry, no chained-credential graph — `ARCHITECTURE.md` §11).
- [x] `seeder` — minefield + active placement; automated jittered freshness/
  rotation (`RunAutoRefresh`); scope-aware `MemRegistry`; the M7 negative-space
  placement seam (`Planner`/`BroadPlanner`, no-op default).
- [x] `signal` — the emission seam: `Builder` turns an observed touch into a
  valid `contract.SignalEvent` with three guards (scope / socket cookie /
  placement); never a partial event.
- **Exit (met):** catalog + seeder produce real, harmless canaries and the
  registry metadata an adapter needs; `cmd/engine` wires the seed-weights prior;
  38 canary/integration tests (harmlessness with negative arms incl. encrypted/
  OpenSSH keys, no-chained-credential, scope isolation, concurrency, bidirectional
  import-graph, touch→Build→Submit). Designed + adversarially reviewed via
  workflows (21 confirmed findings applied). `make check` green locally and on the
  box. Real placement locations + live negative-space planner land with M4/M7.

#### M6 — Sting: attrition  · 4–6 days · *the differentiator* · ← **DONE (2026-06-07)**
- [x] `attrition` — pull-based **stream** (delay-as-data; the driver owns the
  timer, attrition never sleeps) over three provably-bounded generators: `tarpit`
  (slow-drip), `fake_tree` (deterministic link-back directory/config maze,
  idempotent per path), and `token_bait` (token-maximizing parser-hostile bait —
  the patent-flagged novelty; full version shipped, isolated behind the
  `FloorAggressive` gate; FTO framing in `docs/AI_BAIT.md`).
- [x] Hard **per-flow budget** + host-wide **`Governor`** (atomic global byte
  ceiling + concurrent-stream cap + **kill switch** tripped by operator AND
  engine). Floors passive / moderate / aggressive; conservative default enforced
  three structural ways (aggressive never silent; no tier alone raises the floor).
- [x] Attacker-cost meter (`Outcome`: bytes served, time held, est. tokens,
  requests absorbed, depth) whose cost fields map onto `intelligence.StingOutcome`,
  copied at the composition root (attrition imports neither engine nor
  intelligence — import-graph test enforced). Feeds D1/D3.
- [x] **Harmlessness factored out:** new stdlib-only `internal/harmless` package
  is the single source of truth for the reserved/EXAMPLE + structural-invalidity
  predicates; both the M3 canary catalog and attrition bait depend on it. Every
  emitted chunk passes `harmless.CrossScan`, proven at construction.
- **Exit (met):** a scripted attacker gets stuck in bounded, endless, cheap-to-us
  deception; the cost meter climbs while per-chunk defender allocations stay flat
  (benchmark-proven). `cmd/sting-selfcheck` prints the attacker-vs-defender ledger
  and gates CI. The real-agent run is M9. **Track A (engine + canary + attrition)
  complete.**

### Track B — the kernel + proxy integration (AWS Linux)

#### M0 — Repo + dev infrastructure  · 1 day · *together*  ← **DONE (2026-06-05)**
- [x] `git init`, baseline commit, tooling cruft ignored.
- [x] Roadmap committed.
- [x] Private remote created and pushed (`github.com/henleda/canarysting`).
- [x] `Makefile`: `build vet test proto bpf run-engine demo` targets.
- [x] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — two-job CI (Go gate + clang/eBPF build, ubuntu).
- [x] **AWS dev box stood up** via Terraform (`deploy/dev-box/`): `m7g.large`
  Graviton arm64, Ubuntu 24.04 (kernel 6.17-aws, **BTF present**), Go 1.25.3,
  clang 18.1.3, bpftool v7.7.0, libbpf, Docker; dedicated VPC/subnet, SG locked
  to operator IP, SSH key auth, IMDSv2-only, encrypted gp3. Also the M7 host.
- **Exit (met):** `make check` green locally; AWS box reachable and eBPF-capable
  (BTF + bpftool verified); `go build ./...` green on **both** macOS/arm64 and the
  box (Linux/arm64).

#### M4 — Envoy adapter (real dataplane)  · 4–6 days · ← **DONE (2026-06-08)**
- [x] Real `adapters/envoy` via **ext_proc** (decision: ext_proc, not ext_authz —
  only it can stream the future attrition body) + a `canarysting` dynamic-metadata
  suspicious tag; per-tier fail behavior (fail-open T1, fail-closed T3) via a
  contract-typed `FailPolicy`; socket-cookie stamping behind a `CookieResolver`
  seam; out-of-process engine over the existing `api/proto` gRPC boundary
  (`api/enginegrpc`). Pure-Go, ~85% of M4, all unit-tested with a `FakeResolver` +
  fake ext_proc stream; `cmd/envoy-selfcheck` gates CI. (Adversarial review: 20
  findings applied.)
- [x] **ON-BOX:** `bpf/sockops` — the sockops eBPF program + bpf2go + the
  `MapResolver` (the socket-cookie bridge, the §7 de-risk) **proven on the box**
  via a `SO_COOKIE` oracle + delete-on-close test; `deploy/m4-demo/` — backend
  behind a host-networked Envoy (v1.34.1) with the ext_proc filter, the engine +
  adapter as host processes, a scripted attacker, and `run-demo.sh` as the
  end-to-end exit-bar gate.
- **Exit (met):** `run-demo.sh` on the box — a real HTTP attacker through real
  Envoy produces real verdicts, each carrying a non-zero **kernel-resolved socket
  cookie carried end-to-end** (kernel → sockops map → ext_proc 4-tuple →
  SignalEvent → engine → verdict); legit traffic produces no signal.
- **Dep correction (2026-06-07):** the §7 plan assumed the ext_proc protos sit in
  go-control-plane's root module; they don't — they're a separately-versioned
  submodule `.../go-control-plane/envoy`, pinned to `v1.32.x` to hold go 1.22.
- **eBPF notes (2026-06-08):** verifier forbids `&skops->field` (read ctx ip fields
  by value); `remote_port` carries the port in the high 16 bits, network order
  (`bpf_ntohl`). Both found + fixed empirically on the box.

#### M5 — eBPF identity join + containment  · 5–8 days · *together* · *the CISO proof*
- `bpf/loader` (cilium/ebpf) + `bpf/enforce/enforce.bpf.c` — cgroup/TC hook,
  verdict map keyed by **socket cookie**, actions rate-limit / hard-deny / jail.
- The real identity join: socket cookie read at both the Envoy adapter and the
  kernel; Tier-3 jail of the exact flow; bystander on the same host unaffected.
- `sting/containment` drives the loader; refuses to act on unattributable flows.
- **Exit:** Tier 3 jails the attacker socket in-kernel on AWS; a bystander keeps
  working (the precision proof) — the moment that lands the CISO.

### Track C — the real environment + the visible product

#### M7 — Persistent staged environment: real baseline + calibration  · ongoing, started early
- Stand up the staged microservice environment as an **always-on** workload on
  the AWS host so it generates **genuine** east-west traffic continuously.
- Run **baseline mode** for a real, operator-set learning window so a real
  per-scope baseline accrues (no placeholder). This also exercises the
  observe-only pilot motion we sell.
- Accrue **real feedback labels** (via the analyst path) so calibrated mode and
  learned weights are genuinely reached before demo day.
- **Exit:** by demo time, the scope is genuinely calibrated and has a real
  baseline; the credibility panels show real state.
- **Note:** start this as early as the environment can run (after M4/M5 give it a
  real dataplane and kernel path) so the window has elapsed by demo day.

#### M8 — Product dashboard (Next.js, polished)  · 6–10 days · parallel once M1 emits data
- The product dashboard (the §1 screen): live scores, tier ladder, scope/
  calibration state, attacker-cost meter, guardrail + baseline panels. Highly
  polished — CISO-grade. **Separate from the corporate `canarysting-www`.**
- Backed only by real engine/environment data (no mock data).
- **Exit:** the screen tells the story end-to-end from real state.

#### M9 — Scenario + LLM attacker  · 4–7 days
- Scenario orchestration: one command stands up the staged attack.
- Scripted attacker for repeatability; then a **real LLM agent** harness that
  actually probes and burns tokens against the attrition — the why-now made
  visible (ties to the GTG-1002 narrative in the market report).
- **Exit:** the demo runs end-to-end with a real agent burning real tokens.

#### M10 — Package for design partners  · 2–4 days
- Scripted, repeatable demo; AWS deploy manifests in `deploy/`; a runbook; the
  **observe-only baseline pilot** framing as the leave-behind
  (`TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` §4/§10).
- **Exit:** we can run the demo for a prospect and leave them in observe-only.

#### M11 — Kubernetes / EKS demo  · scoped after §7 research lands · *future*
- Port the staged demo to Kubernetes (likely EKS): eBPF as a privileged
  DaemonSet, the Envoy integration as mesh-native or sidecar, scope key from
  SPIFFE trust domain / cluster UID. Informed by the §7 research findings.
- **Exit:** the same demo runs on a real K8s cluster — the form most enterprise
  prospects actually run.

### Track D — the intelligence layer (the data-asset moat)

The compounding asset. Specced in `INTELLIGENCE.md`; this track sequences its §8
build order into the demo. Every tier obeys the three guardrails that never
relax: the canary touch is the only trigger (`BASELINE_MULTIPLIER.md`), learned
state is scope-isolated (`SCOPE.md`), and only anonymized patterns cross a
deployment boundary (`INTELLIGENCE.md` §2). The derivation logic is pure Go
(developed and unit-tested locally on synthetic event sequences); the *real*
profiles, metrics, and patterns accrue from the running environment (M7), so
this track's credible demo state rides on a learning window that now must include
**real adversary-interaction history**, not just benign baseline (see §4).

#### D1 — Vantage point: the event store  · 2–3 days · *foundation, everything depends on it*
- Finish `internal/intelligence/event.go`: the `AdversaryInteractionEvent`
  (already scaffolded) plus a real per-scope `EventStore` (in-memory + a durable
  local backing), scope-keyed, deployment-local, never emitting across a boundary
  (`INTELLIGENCE.md` §3.3).
- Wire capture into the live path: M1 populates tier/verdict, M3 the canary type,
  **M6 the sting outcome + cost proxies**, M5 the real socket-cookie `FlowID`.
- **Tests as invariants:** store isolates by `ScopeKey`; `Query` never returns
  cross-scope events; no raw payloads/addresses/identities recorded.
- **Exit:** every canary interaction in the live run lands as a structured,
  scope-keyed event the higher tiers consume. *(Starts after M1; completed as
  M3/M6/M5 fill the remaining fields.)*

#### D2 — Adversary profiling  · 5–8 days · *the moat input*
- `internal/intelligence/profile/`: derive **behavioral fingerprints** from event
  sequences (probing order, canary-type sequence, reaction to tag/tarpit, timing)
  — built to carry **no** environment-identifying detail, because the fingerprint
  is the unit the cross-customer network (D6) may share.
- The **AI-attacker profiler** (`INTELLIGENCE.md` §4.2): structured, reaction-
  labeled, cost-quantified output, shaped as a clean training signal for the
  future bait model (Model 2; not built here, but the interface is). Keep the
  profiler→bait→events loop an explicit, testable boundary (§4.3).
- **Tests:** a fingerprint is reproducible from the same event sequence; a
  fingerprint provably contains no scope-identifying field (gate for D6).
- **Exit:** real interaction history yields reusable, shareable-safe profiles.
  *(Needs D1 + real events from M7/M9.)*

#### D3 — Attacker-cost metric  · 1–2 days · *the board-level KPI*
- `internal/intelligence/cost/`: a clean reporting view over the event store —
  time imposed, tokens/compute extracted, requests absorbed, per period, per
  scope, aggregated. Derived entirely from the deployment's own events; leaves
  the boundary only if the operator exports their own number.
- This is the meter from the M6 attrition demo, operationalized into the renewal-
  lever KPI the M8 dashboard surfaces.
- **Exit:** a real, defensible attacker-cost number per scope. *(Needs D1 + M6
  cost proxies; mostly aggregation.)*

#### D4 — Reconnaissance early-warning signal  · 2–3 days
- `internal/intelligence/recon/`: a distinct low-tier signal from canary touches
  in the negative space combined with baseline deviation **as context only**
  (never a trigger — `BASELINE_MULTIPLIER.md` §5 holds). Surface to the operator
  as an early-warning feed, not an enforcement action.
- **Exit:** quiet pre-attack probing is surfaced ahead of the loud part, without
  ever tripping the guardrail. *(Needs D1 + the M7 baseline.)*

#### D5 — In-deployment detection sharpening  · 3–4 days · *guardrail-critical*
- A known fingerprint (D2) raises the weight of a *matching canary touch* — as
  **weight context within the multiplier bounds** (`BASELINE_MULTIPLIER.md`),
  **never** as an independent trigger. Integrates into the M1/M2 scoring path;
  stays within the scope; obeys scope isolation.
- **Tests:** a fingerprint match alone (no canary touch) takes **no** action;
  the sharpened weight stays within `M ∈ [1, M_max]`.
- **Exit:** local profiles sharpen local detection without weakening the
  guardrail. *(Needs D2 + M1/M2.)*

#### D6 — Cross-customer intelligence network  · 6–9 days · *the moat, the trust-critical chokepoint*
- `internal/intelligence/network/`: build the **egress filter first and most
  carefully** — the single **default-deny** chokepoint; a field leaves only if
  explicitly marked safe and justified. Then anonymize/aggregate, then the
  shared-set consumer (returns as detection context per D5, never as a trigger).
  Participation (contribute / consume) is a per-deployment opt-in input.
- **Demo truthfully:** stand up a **real second deployment/scope** so the network
  has something to cross *to*. The demo shows a fingerprint leaving deployment A
  through the filter (with raw/identifying candidates **dropped on screen**) and
  sharpening detection in deployment B. No mock data — B is a real scope.
- **Tests as invariants (this is the rule the whole product is sold on):** the
  filter drops every raw/environment-identifying field by default; nothing but
  cleared, anonymized patterns can cross; an un-opted-in scope neither contributes
  nor is identifiable. One chokepoint, fully tested.
- **Exit:** an anonymized pattern learned in A measurably sharpens B, and the
  egress filter provably lets nothing else cross. *(Needs D2; the long pole of
  this track.)*

#### D7 — Threat-intelligence feed  · 3–5 days · *second product line*
- `internal/intelligence/feed/`: a read view over the anonymized, aggregated set
  (D6), with its own access control and rate limiting. Carries derived patterns
  only, never customer data — inherits all D6 constraints.
- **Exit:** an external consumer (SIEM/ISAC framing) reads the feed; it contains
  patterns only, proven by the same egress discipline. *(Needs D6.)*

## 4. Sequencing and parallelism

- **Engine track (A)** is developed locally and unblocks everything: M1 → M2,
  M3, M6 in parallel after M1.
- **Integration track (B)** needs the AWS box (M0): M4 (Envoy) → M5 (eBPF join +
  containment). This is now on the critical path because the CISO demo requires
  the kernel proof.
- **M7** (real baseline/calibration) must start as early as the environment can
  run, because a real learning window takes real time — it is the long pole and
  cannot be compressed without faking data, which we've ruled out.
- **M8** (dashboard) starts as soon as M1 emits verdicts and runs in parallel;
  its intelligence panels (D2/D3/D4/D6) come online as those tiers land.
- **Intelligence track (D)** layers on the others: **D1** (event store) can begin
  right after M1 and is completed as M3/M6/M5 fill its fields; **D2/D3/D4/D5** are
  pure-Go derivations developed locally on synthetic events, then fed real data by
  M7; **D6/D7** (cross-customer, feed) are the track's long pole and need a real
  **second** deployment/scope to demo truthfully. D5 and D6 are guardrail/egress-
  critical — built slowly, fully tested.
- **M9** (LLM attacker) lands last in the core demo **and** runs *during* the M7
  window so real adversary-interaction history accrues for D2/D3/D4; **M10**
  packages; **M11** (K8s) follows the first demo.

```

**The long pole is M7**, now wider: a real baseline + real calibration **and**
real adversary-interaction history all need real elapsed time on a real
environment — and the full-intelligence-track decision (§0.8) means the attacker
(M9) has to be running *inside* that window, not just at demo time, so D2/D3/D4
have genuine data. Standing up that environment early (right after M4/M5) and
pointing the attacker at it continuously is the single most schedule-sensitive
move, precisely because we refuse to fake it. D6 (cross-customer) adds a second
real scope — fold that into the environment plan from the start.

## 5. How we build (discipline that keeps the demo honest)

- **Tests encode the invariants.** Each `CLAUDE.md` core rule gets a test that
  fails if violated — scope isolation, the guardrail (`base=0 ⇒ score=0`),
  refuse-to-start, fail-open/closed, attrition budget ceiling. The demo is only
  as trustworthy as these.
- **No mock data in the demo path.** Real baseline, real calibration, real
  socket-cookie join, real Envoy, real kernel enforcement. Fixtures are allowed
  in *unit tests*; they never appear on the demo screen.
- **Respect the seams.** The engine never imports an adapter or proxy SDK; the
  contract never imports outward.
- **Smallest change that satisfies the milestone.** No speculative generality.
- **Update docs with intent changes.** New learned parameter ⇒ documented
  uncalibrated default + feedback loop + evidence floor, here and in the layer
  doc.

## 6. Decisions

| # | Decision | Resolution (2026-06-03) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | GitHub remote | **Resolved** — private repo `github.com/henleda/canarysting`; transfer to a `canarysting` org later. |
| 2 | Reference dataplane vs Envoy first | **Resolved** — real Envoy, no reference dataplane. |
| 3 | Front-end stack | **Resolved** — Next.js, highly polished, CISO-grade. |
| 4 | LLM-attacker | **Resolved** — scripted for dev loop, real LLM agent for the demo. |
| 5 | First-demo persona | **Resolved** — enterprise CISOs + infra teams; kernel enforcement is core to demo #1. |
| 6 | Demo data | **Resolved** — no placeholder/dummy data; real baseline + calibration from a persistent staged environment. |
| 7 | First-demo footprint | **Resolved** — single-host containers; K8s/EKS is a follow-on (M11). |
| 8 | AWS specifics | **Resolved (2026-06-05)** — account `113938649684` (IAM user `canarysting-dev`, not root), region `us-east-1`, `m7g.large` Graviton arm64 Ubuntu 24.04, SSH-key access locked to operator IP, Terraform IaC in `deploy/dev-box/`. |
| 9 | Intelligence scope for demo #1 | **Resolved (2026-06-05)** — the **full** intelligence track (Track D, D1–D7) is in demo #1, including the cross-customer network demonstrated with a real second deployment. Widens the M7 long pole (real adversary history during the window). |

## 7. Kubernetes feasibility (research findings, 2026-06-03)

**Bottom line: Kubernetes is not a problem for this design — it is the design's
native habitat.** The substrate we need (a privileged eBPF DaemonSet doing
cgroup/TCX enforcement, socket-cookie correlation, and cgroup→pod attribution) is
exactly what Cilium and Tetragon already ship in production on EKS. The novel
parts (deception trigger, non-triggering baseline multiplier, attrition) sit
*above* the substrate and are unaffected by the orchestrator. Porting to K8s is
deployment-shape work, not a redesign. There is **one** real integration risk to
de-risk early (socket-cookie stamping at Envoy, below); it applies to the
single-host demo too, so we hit it during M4/M5 regardless.

### What the research confirmed

- **The socket-cookie L7↔kernel join works on Linux/K8s.** The socket cookie is
  stable for the life of the socket and is a global unique identifier. Userspace
  can read it via `getsockopt(SO_COOKIE)` and it equals the value
  `bpf_get_socket_cookie()` sees in the kernel (verified by a kernel selftest that
  cross-checks SO_COOKIE against `sock_diag`). That is precisely the join
  `IDENTITY.md` mandates. **Caveat:** the cookie is *per-socket and host-local* —
  it never crosses the wire, and a client socket and a server socket have
  different cookies. So we enforce on the offending socket *where it lives*; we do
  not correlate a cookie across hosts. That matches our model (enforce the flow at
  its endpoint) but must stay explicit.
- **EKS node AMIs are modern and BTF-capable.** Current EKS-optimized **Amazon
  Linux 2023** AMIs run kernel **6.12.x** (e.g. 6.12.46, 6.12.53 in late-2025
  builds); **Bottlerocket** is typically first to pick up new kernel eBPF
  features. AL2 AMIs stopped publishing **Nov 26, 2025**; AL2023 + Bottlerocket
  are the supported AMIs for K8s 1.33+. **Caveat:** there are real, reported
  per-build BTF breakages ("failed to find valid kernel BTF" on specific
  AL2023/Bottlerocket versions), so we **pin and test the exact AMI version** and
  carry a BTFHub fallback for CO-RE.
- **CNI coexistence is solved by TCX + cgroup hooks.** **TCX** (kernel 6.6+) gives
  safe ownership, explicit ordering, and multi-program coexistence at the TC hooks
  — built specifically so third-party BPF coexists with the CNI; Cilium itself
  migrated to TCX. The AWS VPC CNI is the EKS default and chains cleanly. Doing
  enforcement at **cgroup hooks** (`cgroup/skb`, `cgroup/connect`) plus TCX, rather
  than clobbering legacy `tc`, keeps us out of the CNI's way. **Tetragon (GA v1.0,
  2024, production on EKS) is the existence proof** for our exact deployment shape:
  a privileged eBPF security DaemonSet running alongside the CNI.
- **Socket→pod→workload attribution is well-trodden.** cgroup v2 gives every
  process a stable 64-bit `cgroupid`; `bpf_skb_cgroup_id()` (kernel 5.2+) reads it,
  and `skb->sk → task → cgroup` lets us map socket→container→pod. Tetragon already
  enriches with pod/namespace metadata. **SPIFFE identity stays an L7-side
  attribute** (Envoy sees it via mTLS) joined to kernel state by the socket cookie
  — exactly `SCOPE.md` + `IDENTITY.md`, unchanged.
- **Envoy/Istio: own our Envoy; mind ambient mode.** ext_proc/ext_authz inject
  via `EnvoyFilter` in **sidecar** Istio, but the `EnvoyFilter` API is still Alpha
  and fragile, and is **not supported in Istio ambient mode** at all. In ambient,
  L7 lives in **waypoint proxies** (ztunnel is Rust, L4-only); ext_proc must attach
  at the waypoint (Envoy Gateway / kgateway support this). **Implication:** the
  credible, robust path is to **own the Envoy we attach to** (ship it, or be the
  waypoint) rather than patch a customer's sidecar via a fragile EnvoyFilter —
  which also matches our "thin adapter we control" model.

### The one early risk to de-risk (M4/M5)

**Stamping the socket cookie at Envoy.** Envoy does not natively surface
`SO_COOKIE` to an ext_proc filter, and `bpf_get_socket_cookie()` is unavailable in
some eBPF contexts (e.g. `cgroup/getsockopt`). The proven pattern is a **sockops
eBPF program that captures the cookie and a map keyed by the ephemeral source
port**, which the L7 side (or a companion cgroup program) reads back to stamp the
cookie onto the signal event. This is the load-bearing piece of `IDENTITY.md`'s
"no second join mechanism" rule, and it is the same on a single host as in K8s —
so we **prove it during M4/M5 on the single-host demo**, and K8s inherits it.

### Recommended K8s approach (for M11)

- eBPF enforcement + observation as a **privileged DaemonSet** (CAP_BPF,
  CAP_NET_ADMIN, CAP_SYS_ADMIN as required), one per node — the Tetragon shape.
- Enforce at **cgroup hooks + TCX**, never legacy `tc` clobbering; chain cleanly
  with AWS VPC CNI (and validate ordering if Cilium CNI is present).
- **Own the Envoy** (our dataplane, or the ambient waypoint); the sockops bridge
  stamps the socket cookie where ext_proc can't read it directly.
- **EKS nodes:** AL2023 or Bottlerocket, **pinned AMI version**, kernel 6.x with
  BTF verified on that exact build; CO-RE with a BTFHub fallback.
- **Scope key** from SPIFFE trust domain (mesh) or cluster UID, joined to kernel
  state by socket cookie + cgroup→pod attribution. No design change from §
  `SCOPE.md`.

## 8. Status log

- **2026-06-03** — M0 in progress. Repo initialized; scaffold committed; roadmap
  added; private remote created and pushed. Design review completed and decisions
  1–7 locked (see §6). Roadmap restructured: kernel enforcement pulled into the
  core demo, reference dataplane dropped in favor of real Envoy, no-placeholder-
  data constraint adopted (persistent staged environment for real baseline +
  calibration, M7), Next.js dashboard, phased LLM attacker, single-host-first
  with a K8s follow-on (M11). Kubernetes feasibility research kicked off (§7).
  Next: Makefile + CI eBPF job + AWS dev box.
- **2026-06-05** — Repo reconciled after the local `.git` was lost and the tree
  partly regenerated on a stale base (recovered ROADMAP, Makefile, two-job CI,
  gofmt'd code, gitignore cruft entries; kept the new intelligence layer). The
  **intelligence layer** landed: `INTELLIGENCE.md` + `internal/intelligence/`
  (event type/store + recon/profile/cost/feed/network scaffolds), committed and
  pushed to `main`. Plan **rebuilt** to fold it in: new **Track D (D1–D7)**,
  decision 9 (full intelligence track in demo #1), demo narrative beat 7 (the
  moat), and §4 re-sequenced — the M7 long pole now also requires real
  adversary-interaction history (M9 running inside the learning window) and a
  second real scope for D6. M0 still open on the **AWS dev box** (next action).
- **2026-06-05** — **M0 complete.** AWS dev box stood up with Terraform
  (`deploy/dev-box/`): `m7g.large` Graviton arm64, Ubuntu 24.04, kernel 6.17-aws
  with BTF present; Go 1.25.3 + clang 18.1.3 + bpftool v7.7.0 + libbpf + Docker;
  dedicated VPC, SG locked to operator IP, SSH-key auth, IMDSv2-only, encrypted
  disk. `go build ./...` verified green on the box (Linux/arm64) and locally.
  AWS access moved off root to IAM user `canarysting-dev`. Decision 8 resolved.
  Track A (M1 engine core) and Track B (M4 Envoy) are now unblocked; M7 can begin
  once the dataplane lands.
- **2026-06-05** — **M1 (Engine core) complete.** `internal/engine` implements
  the brain end-to-end in-process: `scope.StaticResolver` (resolution order +
  refuse-to-start), `scoring.WindowedScorer` (windowed weighted sum over distinct
  touches, benign-exclusion, uniform=raw-count cold start), `tiers.StaticDecider`
  (static threshold map from the §8 FP bands, async-only 0–1, fail-open T1 /
  fail-closed T3 enforced in config Validate), `calibration.Store` (per-scope
  evidence floor gating uncalibrated→calibrated, seed-prior-regularized learned
  weights, no cross-scope aggregation), `engine.Service` (implements
  `contract.Engine`) and `feedback.Intake`. `cmd/engine` wires it with a real
  refuse-to-start path. 43 tests, `make check` green. Calibrated-mode threshold-
  FP-solving and the M2 baseline multiplier are documented as the next increments
  (`docs/ENGINE.md`). Unblocks M2, M3, M6, and the D1 event store.
- **2026-06-05** — **M2 (Baseline multiplier) complete.** `internal/engine/baseline`
  implements the bounded multiplier `M` exactly per `BASELINE_MULTIPLIER.md`:
  per-feature cap → Euclidean `d` → saturating `g(d)=d/(d+k)` → `M=1+(M_max−1)g`,
  `M ∈ [1, M_max]` (defaults `M_max=3.0, k=0.5, c_max=1.0`, also in `config/`).
  `scoring` applies `Score = B × M` (floor-of-one clamp); `baseline.Store` forces
  `M=1.0` when uncalibrated/stale/bucket-sparse (gated to the shared evidence
  floor). 61 engine tests (the five §1 invariants, the four §5 worked examples,
  outlier bounding, monotonicity, the three gates); `make check` green locally
  and on the box. The live baseline + per-flow feature derivation come from the
  eBPF path (M5/M7); until then `M=1` in the scoring path. Track A engine work
  (M1+M2) done; remaining Track A: M3 canary, M6 attrition.
- **2026-06-05** — **M3 (Canary layer) complete.** `internal/canary/{catalog,
  seeder,signal}` is the detection surface: 5 provably-harmless decoy types
  (reserved/EXAMPLE namespaces + structural invalidity, enforced at 3 layers + a
  universal cross-scan), seed-weight priors fed once into calibration, a flat
  scope-keyed placement registry (independent — no chained-credential graph), the
  M7 negative-space `Planner` seam, automated jittered freshness, and the
  `signal.Builder` emission seam (3 guards, never a partial event). Zero change to
  `internal/contract` or the engine; both-directions import-graph guard. Built
  via a design workflow (research + 3 lenses + judged synthesis) and hardened via
  an adversarial review workflow (21 confirmed findings applied — incl. a catalog
  RNG data race, encrypted/OpenSSH-key inertness gaps, and an Active-mode rotation
  collapse). 99 repo tests, `make check` green locally and on the box. Remaining
  Track A: **M6 attrition** (the differentiator).
- **2026-06-07** — **M6 (Sting: attrition) complete.** `internal/sting/attrition`
  implements the differentiator as a pull-based, clock-free **stream** (delay is
  data; the driver owns the timer, attrition never sleeps → O(1) work per chunk,
  the defender is never burned). Three provably-bounded generators built iteratively
  (never recursion): `tarpit` (slow-drip duration cost), `fake_tree` (deterministic
  idempotent maze), and the patent-flagged `token_bait` (multi-byte byte-fallback +
  BPE-merge-breaking + bounded nested JSON — full version, isolated behind
  `FloorAggressive`; FTO framing in new `docs/AI_BAIT.md`). Per-flow `Budget` under a
  shared host-wide `Governor` (atomic byte ceiling + concurrent-stream cap + dual-trip
  kill switch). Aggressive-never-silent enforced three structural ways. Attacker-cost
  `Outcome` mirrors `intelligence.StingOutcome` (copied at the composition root; an
  import-graph test proves attrition imports only contract + harmless). **Harmlessness
  factored out** into a new stdlib-only `internal/harmless` package — single source of
  truth for the safety predicates, now shared by the M3 catalog and attrition bait
  (M3 refactored onto it; its adversarial-review coverage preserved). New
  `cmd/sting-selfcheck` prints the attacker-vs-defender ledger and gates CI. Built via
  a design workflow (3 research strands + 3 lenses + judged synthesis); decisions:
  full token_bait now, harmlessness factored out (both founder-approved). Full repo
  green under `-race` + `vet`. **Track A (engine M1+M2 + canary M3 + attrition M6)
  done.** Next: Track B (M4 Envoy / M5 eBPF on the box) or Track D (D1 event store).
- **2026-06-07** — **M4 (Envoy adapter) LOCAL HALF.** Built the pure-Go ~85% of the
  ext_proc adapter (`adapters/envoy`), the gRPC engine boundary (`api/gen` /
  `api/convert` / `api/enginegrpc`), the `CookieResolver` seam + `FakeResolver`, and
  `cmd/{engine -grpc-addr, envoy-adapter, envoy-selfcheck}`. First external deps
  (go-control-plane/envoy, grpc, protobuf, cilium/ebpf) added and pinned to hold go
  1.22. Design + adversarial-review workflows (20 findings applied). Pushed
  (`9699ab3`, `c49165c`).
- **2026-06-08** — **M4 COMPLETE (on-box).** `bpf/sockops` socket-cookie bridge —
  sockops eBPF (PASSIVE_ESTABLISHED capture + delete-on-close) + bpf2go + the
  `MapResolver` — **proven on the box** (`SO_COOKIE` oracle + delete-on-close). Two
  eBPF gotchas fixed live (ctx-ptr deref; `remote_port` high-16/`bpf_ntohl`).
  `deploy/m4-demo/` (host-networked Envoy v1.34.1 + backend + scripted attacker +
  `run-demo.sh`) demonstrates and gates the exit bar: **real attacker → real Envoy →
  real verdict, socket cookie carried end-to-end** — confirmed on the box.
  **Track B M4 done; M5 (eBPF jail) is now unblocked** (the same cookie keys the
  enforcement map). Next: M5, or the M7 learning window (this demo is its substrate),
  or Track D (D1).
